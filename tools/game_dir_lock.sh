#!/usr/bin/env bash
# =============================================================================
# tools/game_dir_lock.sh -- a mutex over the ONE shared game directory
# =============================================================================
#
# TWO DIRECTORIES: tools/game_dirs.sh pools this one (perf) with a second copy
# (functional) that has a user dir of its own (BANISHED_USER_DIR); take a dir
# from it rather than calling this script with BANISHED_DIR by hand.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Lanes work in isolated git worktrees, so their SOURCE never collides. But every
# lane deploys the same `OpenBA.exe` into `C:/GOG Games/Banished` and every
# lane's run writes the same `standalone_{debug,error,crash}.log` there. The
# worktree isolation makes that easy to forget, because everything else about a
# lane is private.
#
# During Wave 9's eight-lane session this cost real work:
#
#   * three consecutive deploy+run attempts by one lane were clobbered by another
#     lane overwriting the exe in the seconds between `cp` and launch,
#   * a `cp` failed outright with "Device or resource busy" because another lane
#     had the exe running,
#   * one lane's first measurement was silently taken against a DIFFERENT lane's
#     binary and had to be discovered and redone.
#
# The last one is the dangerous class. A clobbered run does not announce itself:
# you get a plausible log, from a plausible exe, that is measuring somebody
# else's code. That is the same shape as every other defect this wave has paid
# for -- an instrument reporting a confident number about the wrong thing.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#
# This is advisory. It cannot stop a lane that does not call it, and it does not
# protect the game data files (`WinData/`, the `.pkm` set). A lane that mounts or
# unmounts mods changes the INPUT of every other lane's run, and no lock over the
# exe will catch that -- announce those changes to the integrator instead.

#
# WAVE 26: STALENESS IS NO LONGER A WALL CLOCK, AND A BREAK IS NO LONGER SILENT
#
# Wave 25 lane ALLOC's lock was broken as stale at 1802s while its process was
# ALIVE and had written to the protected directory 1s earlier, and ALLOC WAS
# NEVER TOLD -- it learned from the integrator, after losing a measurement
# pair. Two changes, both aimed at that:
#
#   * `STALE_AFTER` is a FLOOR, not a verdict. Past it the lock is examined
#     against the liveness evidence `status` was already computing one function
#     away -- holder heartbeat, live OpenBA.exe pids, held handles, last
#     write to the game dir. A lock with any of those is NOT stale at any age
#     below `STALE_HARD`. See the block above `STALE_AFTER` for what this costs
#     and how `STALE_HARD` bounds it.
#   * Breaking a lock leaves a BREACH RECORD naming the victim. `acquire`,
#     `release`, `assert-held`, `heartbeat` and `status <lane>` all shout it,
#     and `release` FAILS instead of printing "nothing to release".
#
# LONG HOLDS: if you hold the lock across a long analysis gap, call
# `heartbeat <lane>` occasionally -- it is the only liveness signal
# attributable to YOU rather than to the machine. `run` does it for you.
#
# IDENTITY, NOT JUST OWNERSHIP: `run` samples the deployed exe's md5 for the
# life of the wrapped command and reports whether it changed WHILE A RUN WAS
# LIVE (a clobber) as opposed to between idle samples (an ordinary deploy). It
# exits 7 if the command succeeded but the identity check did not, and drops
# `exe_identity.tsv` into `--snapshot`. That is ALLOC's per-launch md5 check,
# which is the only reason its contamination question was answerable, turned
# from per-lane discipline into part of the tool.
#
# "IS THE LOCK FREE?" AND "CAN I USE THE DIRECTORY?" ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.
# A process that outlives its run keeps OpenBA.exe and standalone_*.log
# open, so deploys fail with "Device or resource busy" while the lock correctly
# reads free. If a deploy fails that way, do NOT wait for the lock -- run
# `orphans`. See the UNLOCKED RUNS AND ORPHANS block below.
#
#   # the whole point -- deploy and run under ONE lock, so nothing can land
#   # between the copy and the launch:
#   tools/game_dir_lock.sh acquire lane-FOO 900 || exit 1
#
# PREFER, and the reason it exists:
#
#   tools/game_dir_lock.sh run lane-FOO 900 -- make sa-run
#
# READ YOUR LOGS FROM A SNAPSHOT, NOT FROM THE GAME DIR:
#
#   tools/game_dir_lock.sh run lane-FOO 900 --snapshot ./mylogs -- make sa-run
#
# The lock covers deploy+run. It does NOT cover the window in which you sit and
# ANALYSE, and standalone_*.log is overwritten by whoever runs next. On
# 2026-09-09 three consecutive reads of "the" debug log were three different
# processes, and another lane's verification-mode banner was read as a
# default-on regression in the merged tree. `--snapshot` copies the logs while
# the lock is still held, so what you analyse is what you ran.
#
# DEFEATED BY A PIPE -- this cost a real clobber on 2026-09-08. `acquire`
# returns 1 on timeout correctly, but in a pipeline the exit status is the LAST
# command's:
#
#   tools/game_dir_lock.sh acquire lane-FOO 540 2>&1 | tail -3   # <-- ALWAYS 0
#
# The lane read "exit code 0", deployed over another lane's exe mid-run, and
# rewrote its logs -- while the piped text it did not read said TIMEOUT in plain
# English. NEVER pipe `acquire` into head/tail/grep. Use `run` above, or call
# `acquire` bare, or `set -o pipefail`, or:
#
#   if ! tools/game_dir_lock.sh acquire lane-FOO 900; then exit 1; fi
#
# SECOND COSTUME, found 2026-09-10 by Wave 18 lane VDATA, cost ~15 min: it is
# not only pipes. ANY compound command discards the refusal, because the caller
# (or the agent harness reporting the step) sees the status of the LAST element:
#
#   tools/game_dir_lock.sh acquire lane-FOO 540; echo "ACQUIRE_EXIT=$?"   # <-- reports 0
#
# Note what makes this one nastier than the pipe: the echoed text is CORRECT --
# `$?` there really is acquire's status -- so the human-readable output says
# ACQUIRE_EXIT=1 while the step's own exit status says 0. Two fields disagree
# and the authoritative-looking one is wrong. A wrapper added to make the status
# more visible is what hid it.
#
# So the rule is not "do not pipe". It is: DO NOT PUT `acquire` IN A COMPOUND
# COMMAND OF ANY KIND -- no pipe, no `;`, no trailing echo, no `&&` tail. Give
# it a statement of its own, and put `assert-held` in front of the dangerous
# action regardless (below). In that lane's case assert-held is what caught it
# before it deployed over another lane.
#
# A granted acquire now also prints a line matching `^\[gamelock\] GRANT `, so a
# caller that must pipe can test for the POSITIVE rather than trusting a status
# that a pipe can swallow. And `verify <lane>` (alias: `assert-held`)
# re-checks ownership immediately before launch.
#
# THE STRONGEST GUARD DOES NOT TRUST `acquire`'S EXIT CODE AT ALL -- a caller
# that forgets the `||` entirely (not even a pipe, just a bare call with no
# check) defeats every mitigation above, and that happened in Wave 11. Put
# `assert-held` directly in front of the dangerous action instead, as its own
# statement that fails the step on its own if ownership is not current:
#
#   tools/game_dir_lock.sh acquire lane-FOO 900
#   tools/game_dir_lock.sh assert-held lane-FOO || exit 1     # <-- copy this line
#   cp build/cmake-debug/OpenBA.exe "$GAME/OpenBA.exe"
#
# This is what `run` already does internally, and it is why `run` is PREFERRED
# over hand-rolling acquire/deploy/release: there is no exit code to discard
# because there is no gap between the check and the action for a bad read of
# it to land in.
#
#   trap 'tools/game_dir_lock.sh release lane-FOO' EXIT
#   cp build/cmake-debug/OpenBA.exe "$GAME/OpenBA.exe"
#   ( cd "$GAME" && BANISHED_AUTOSTART=1 ./OpenBA.exe )
#   cp "$GAME"/standalone_*.log ./my-evidence/     # copy out BEFORE releasing
#
# Releasing before copying the logs out reintroduces the race you just avoided.

# ---- STALENESS: A WALL CLOCK IS NOT EVIDENCE OF DEATH ------------------------
#
# WAVE 25, LANE ALLOC. Its lock was broken as stale at **1802s** while its
# process was ALIVE and had written to the protected directory **one second
# before the staleness check ran**. During the unlocked window another lane
# legitimately acquired the lock this script granted it and deployed over
# ALLOC's exe. That lane did nothing wrong; the instrument did. And ALLOC WAS
# NEVER TOLD -- its own words: "the lock was broken as stale WHILE MY RUN WAS
# LIVE and I got no signal at all -- I only learned from your message." A
# measurement pair was lost.
#
# THE FIX IS NOT A BIGGER NUMBER. `status` already computed, and printed, every
# fact needed to know that holder was alive: live OpenBA.exe pids, held
# handles, and the age of the last write to the game dir. The information
# required NOT to expire a live lock was already inside the tool that expired
# it, one function away, and was never consulted. So:
#
#   * STALE_AFTER is a FLOOR, not a verdict. Past it, the lock is EXAMINED.
#   * A lock is stale only when the wall clock has passed AND every liveness
#     signal is negative (see `lock_staleness`).
#   * A breach is RECORDED where the wronged lane will see it (`record_breach`
#     / `breach_notice`), so a broken lock can never again be silent to its
#     holder.
#
# THE COST OF THE CONSERVATIVE DIRECTION, STATED PLAINLY: the liveness signals
# are NOT ATTRIBUTABLE to the holder, except the heartbeat. A live
# OpenBA.exe started by an UNRELATED lane running unlocked reads here as
# "the holder is alive" and would keep a genuinely dead lock alive. Refusing to
# break is the safe error -- it costs waiting, where the other error costs a
# measurement -- but "safe" is not "forever", so STALE_HARD bounds it. Past the
# hard ceiling the lock is broken on the wall clock alone, as loudly as this
# script can manage, and the breach is still recorded.
STALE_AFTER=3600                 # 60 min: the FLOOR past which evidence is consulted
STALE_HARD=10800                 # 3 h: broken regardless of evidence (deadlock bound)
STALE_IDLE_REQUIRED=600          # the game dir must have been QUIET this long

# it had simply never acquired one. Both statements were true and neither

# ---- UNLOCKED RUNS AND ORPHANS ----------------------------------------------
#
# THE FOURTH VARIANT OF THE CLOBBER CLASS, 2026-09-09. `run_in_progress` has
# always been correct and has always gated the grab. What was missing is that
# NOTHING TOLD ANYONE ABOUT IT. The failure ran like this:
#
#   * the integrator's own run finished and reported completion, but its
#     process lingered ~50 minutes holding standalone_*.log and OpenBA.exe
#     open;
#   * `status` printed "free" -- TRUE, nobody held the lock -- and said nothing
#     about the live process, because its process advisory sat behind
#     `[ -d "$LOCK" ] || return 0` and so only ran when the lock was HELD;
#   * a lane's `acquire` could never grab (run_in_progress was true), fell
#     through to the generic wait, and printed `waiting for '(unknown)'`,
#     because with no lock directory `lock_owner` has nothing to read.
#
# Every individual component was working. The instrument's fault was reporting
# a TRUE statement ("free") that answered a different question from the one
# being asked ("can I use the directory?"). Those are two questions and this
# script now answers both, separately and by name.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CORRECTION, 2026-09-09, AND IT IS THE INTEGRATOR'S OWN ERROR.
#
# This block originally continued: "the lane read that as lock contention,
# reported itself 'queued behind' another lane that in fact held nothing, and
# waited 15 minutes." THAT SENTENCE WAS FALSE, and the lane it described said
# so with evidence.
#
# The orphan was real and was demonstrated: a `cp` failed with "Device or
# resource busy" while `status` said free, and killing the stranded process
# fixed it. What was NOT established is that the orphan caused the OTHER lane's
# 15-minute wait. It did not. That lane's `acquire` printed
# `queued behind 'updateload'` and then `waiting for 'updateload'` -- both
# naming a real lane -- and this script can only produce those two strings when
# a live TICKET is ahead of you (line ~280) and when the lock is genuinely HELD
# (line ~323). In the orphan case there is no lock directory, so `lock_owner`
# has nothing to read and the string would have been `(unknown)`. The message
# the lane actually saw is therefore proof of ordinary, correct FIFO queueing
# behind a lane that really did hold the lock and really was running.
#
# So two conditions were conflated: the integrator's orphan (which blocked the
# INTEGRATOR'S deploy) and a genuine queue (which delayed the other lane). The
# fix below stands on its own evidence and is unaffected -- the silent-orphan
# gap is real whatever caused any particular wait -- but the attribution was
# wrong, and it was wrong in the most seductive direction: an explanation
# offered for SOMEONE ELSE'S anomaly that made the explainer the sole cause,
# tidily accounted for both lanes, and stopped the search. That is exactly
# `reference_a_reconciliation_retires_the_flag.md`. The tell was available at
# the time and was not looked at: the lane quoted a message naming a lane, and
# the orphan branch cannot produce a name.
#
# DIAGNOSTIC RULE THIS LEAVES BEHIND: the two conditions have DIFFERENT
# symptoms and must not be merged. An orphan fails a `cp` with "Device or
# resource busy" while `status` reads free, and never reaches a queue. A real
# queue never reaches a `cp` at all. Ask which one happened before explaining
# either.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# It still does NOT kill anything. A live exe nobody locked is either an orphan
# or a lane running unlocked, and from here those are indistinguishable --
# killing the second one destroys a real measurement. Facts, then a human.

# ---- FIFO ticketing ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# `acquire` used to be a poll-and-grab spin, which is NOT a queue: whoever
# happened to poll in the window after a release won, and a lane that had been
# waiting 29 minutes had no priority over one that arrived a second ago. Lane
# UI3 lost a slot that way on 2026-09-08 after waiting an hour. More timeout
# does not fix that -- it is unfairness, not impatience.
#
# So a waiter takes a TICKET (its lane name, containing the epoch it first
# asked) and may only attempt the grab when it is at the head. A waiter TOUCHES
# its ticket every poll, so a lane that dies while queued stops refreshing and
# its ticket is ignored after TICKET_STALE seconds -- otherwise one dead waiter
# would deadlock every other lane, which is worse than the unfairness it fixes.
#
# Lanes running an older copy of this script take no ticket and still grab as
# before. That is the pre-existing behaviour, not a regression.

# contaminated?" was answerable at all -- without it the question would have
# been an argument between two plausible stories. It was per-lane discipline,
# which means it protected exactly one lane.
#
# So `run` now samples the deployed exe's md5 for the whole life of the wrapped
# command and reports what it saw. The DISCRIMINATOR matters: the exe changing
# is NORMAL -- `make sa-run` deploys, that is the point. What is not normal is
# the exe changing WHILE A RUN IS LIVE. `run_in_progress` already answers "is a
# run live" by the one test that cannot go stale between the check and the
# answer, so a change seen after a live sample is a clobber and a change seen
# between two idle samples is a deploy.
#
# RESIDUAL, STATED: if the game exits between two samples and a deploy lands in
# the same interval, the previous sample still reads live and this reports a
# clobber that was not one. It errs toward shouting. The full sample table is
# printed with the summary (and copied into --snapshot), so the claim is always
# checkable rather than a bare verdict.
