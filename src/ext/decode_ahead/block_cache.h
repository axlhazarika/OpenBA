// src/ext/decode_ahead/block_cache.h -- ext.decode_ahead's worker pool + decoded-block cache
//
// NOT RETAIL (docs/extensions/handins/DECODEAHEAD.md). Standard C++ only (no engine header), so
// tests/unit/ext_decode_ahead_test.cpp drives it with its own decoder.
//
// A job is one compressed block of one stream: its bytes (`src`, `csize`, read-only memory that
// stays valid until the owner is dropped), the size it must decode to (`usize`) and the block's
// identity (owner, index, offset). Workers decode jobs in submission order into the cache's own
// buffers; Take hands one block back, waiting while it is still being decoded. A block is handed
// back only when the decoder produced exactly `usize` bytes; anything else (a damaged block) is
// reported as "no block" and the caller decodes it itself, so a damaged block takes retail's path.
// Drop(owner) forgets an owner's blocks: queued ones are removed, a running one is waited for.
