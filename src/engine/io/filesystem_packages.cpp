// Every mangled name above, and every name reached through RT_EXPORT_ONCE
// below, was read out of Runtime-x64.dll's own export directory with `pefile`
// BEFORE a line of this file was written — and so was every ORDINAL in this
// file, printed straight from the export table's ordinal array plus its
// ordinal base rather than transcribed from a note. That is not ceremony:
// the first draft of this header carried eight ordinals reconstructed by
// hand and SEVEN OF THE EIGHT WERE WRONG (ClosePackages 1904 vs 1728,
// GetPackDirectory 2872 vs 2828, GetFileName 2650 vs 2602, FindFiles 2306 vs
// 2350, ??0PackageFile 505 vs 289, ReadPackfile 3560 vs 3461, CloseFile 1900
// vs 1726). An ordinal is exactly the kind of detail that reads as evidence
// and is never checked by the compiler — not looked up in a decompile, and
// not typed from memory. A name the DLL does not contain resolves NULL
// silently and forever (reference_resolveexport_phantom_names.md).
//
// and leaves every call on the DLL.
//
// NO NEW WIN32 API AND NO NEW IMPORT LIBRARY. This file calls nothing outside
// the Runtime DLL's own surface; SA_LIBS is untouched.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1. THE ROW WAS SIZED WRONG GOING IN, AND THE CORRECTION MATTERS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The lane brief described LoadPackages as "~300 instructions". It is **430**,
// and the extra hundred are not padding: they are a THIRD loop (the path→entry
// index build) and a call to a packfile SORT that the brief's structural
// sketch did not mention at all. The sketch also had the two array-growth
// loops iterating over "[RSI+0x20]/[+0x28]/[+0x2c]" and "[RSI+0x30]/[+0x38]"
// as if those were two different destination arrays. They are not. BOTH loops
// APPEND TO THE SAME ARRAY at +0x20; the difference is the SOURCE they read:
// loop 1 walks the `*.pkg` files FindFiles just discovered, loop 2 walks the
// user/mod pack filenames already sitting in the FileSystem at +0x30.
// Everything below is transcribed from the disassembly at 0x1800ab460, not
// from that sketch or from Ghidra's C (which drops dereferences and prints
// MOVSXD as a zero extension — reference_ghidra_c_output_vs_disassembly.md).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 2. THE BODY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   if (this->existsInPackfileGate == 0) return;          // +0x18, the gate
//
//   ClosePackages(this);                                  // drop any previous mount
//   String pattern = "*.pkg";                             // literal 0x1801556f0
//   Filename packDir = this->GetPackDirectory();          // a copy of +0x10
//   Array<Filename> found;                                // {ptr, count} on the stack
//   this->FindFiles(packDir, pattern, /*recursive*/false, found);
//   ~packDir; ~pattern;
//
//   for (i = 0; i < found.count; ++i)                     // LOOP 1
//       append(this->packfiles, ReadPackfile(new PackageFile, found[i]));
//   if (this->packfileCount > 1) SortPackfiles(...);      // 0x1800264a0
//   for (i = 0; i < this->userPackFilenameCount; ++i)     // LOOP 2
//       append(this->packfiles, ReadPackfile(new PackageFile, this->userPackFilenames[i]));
//
//   for (pi = 0; pi < this->packfileCount; ++pi)          // LOOP 3 — the index
//       for (fi = 0; fi < packfiles[pi]->entryCount; ++fi) {
//           Filename key = packfiles[pi]->GetFileName(fi);
//           node = IndexFind(this->packfileIndexRoot, key);
//           if (node) { if (packfiles[node->packIndex]->overridable) node->value = {pi,fi}; }
//           else      BstInsert(&this->tree, &out, key, {pi,fi});
//           ~key;
//       }
//
//   ...then the temporary Filename array is released element by element and
//   its block freed.
//
// The `*.pkg` literal was read with `read_memory` at 0x1801556f0 and is the
// five bytes `*.pkg`, NUL-terminated — not guessed from the function's name.
// It agrees with the install on disk: C:\GOG Games\Banished\WinData holds
// data0.pkg, data1.pkg, patch0.pkg and patch1.pkg, and lane FS independently
// established that GetPackDirectory's +0x10 resolves to that same WinData
// directory. So loop 1 runs FOUR times on a stock install, which is the fact
// §5 turns on.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 3. THE PACKFILE GATE IS OPEN HERE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE FROM
//    LANE FS
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `??0FileSystem@IO@@QEAA@XZ` (0x1800ac7c0) writes `MOV word ptr [RCX+0x18],
// 0x100`, i.e. +0x18 = 0 and +0x19 = 1. Lane FS used exactly that to prove the
// packfile arm of `FileSystem::Exists` was DEAD inside SetupDirectories.
//
// It is not dead here. `FileSystem::Startup` sets `this->existsInPackfileGate
// = 1` BETWEEN the two calls (src/engine/io/filesystem_startup.cpp), so by the
// time control reaches LoadPackages the byte is 1 — and attempt 11's crash
// dump read `this[+0x18] = 0x101`, which is the same fact measured live rather
// than derived. The `JZ epilogue` at 0x1800ab483 is therefore NOT taken and the
// entire body below is live.
//
// See §6 for what that does to lane FS's ExistsInPackfile holdback. Short
// version: it kills it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 4. WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT PORT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// LoadPackages' callee set does not close in this lane, and pretending
// otherwise would be worse than saying so. Written out here so the next lane
// inherits a list and not an archaeology task. Each is called through the
// PROPER door — RT_EXPORT_ONCE for an exported name, ResolveAddr for an
// unexported internal — so a run that reaches one dies with its NAME on
// [RtUnresolved] rather than silently doing nothing:
//
//   ?FindFiles@FileSystem@IO@@QEBAX…      0x1800ad7a0  ord 2350   289 instrs
//       The `*.pkg` enumeration. A FindFirstFileW/FindNextFileW/FindClose loop
//       through dispatch slots 0x18014b0d8/0e0/0e8, plus a recursive second
//       half behind its `bool` parameter (passed FALSE here). Its own callees
//       are already ported: WideString ctor/Set/AsUTF8 (lane FS), String
//       operator+ (0x1800c9440), Filename::AdjustDelimiters (0x1800c6970);
//       the one that is not is Array<Filename>::Insert at 0x180026880.
//       **THIS IS THE NEXT WALL — see §8.**
//   ??0PackageFile@IO@@QEAA@XZ            0x1800b4440  ord  289    48 instrs
//       A plain field-initialising constructor, and cheap — EXCEPT that it
//       writes three vtable pointers and only two of them are minted. See §7.

//       ***PORTED 2026-09-08 by Wave 9 lane COLL*** (avl_trees.cpp). Note it
//       releases exactly ONE element slot (the key String) and NOT the second:
//       here that slot is the packed {packIndex,fileIndex} qword, and the same
//       body serves other instantiations, so a symmetric release would corrupt
//       the heap on the first call.
//   FUN_180025a80 → FUN_180025c70 (BST insert)         0x180025a80

//       0x180008520, 0x180008840 and 0x180025e10. The prediction below is
//       exactly right and is worth keeping: it IS the insert twin of the config
//       map's find, comparator and null-key asymmetries included, and it IS
//       keyed with _stricmp rather than the signed strcmp. It is also a full
//       AVL insert, not a plain BST one — 0x180025e10 is a rebalancing
//       retrace and the node carries a balance and a height.
//       …which in turn needs FUN_180008520 (node alloc) and FUN_180025e10
//       (the rebalance). Structurally the insert twin of the config map's find
//       that src/engine/system/configuration.cpp already ports, comparator and
//       null-key asymmetries included — but keyed with _stricmp (see below),
//       not the signed-char strcmp that file uses.

//       (src/engine/collection/introsort.cpp). The objection recorded here and
//       at the call site was correct and is what the port had to answer, not a
//       reason not to do it: an oracle DOES exist, because the shipped body is
//       a LEAF (no CALL instructions) and a sort is a pure permutation of a
//       caller-owned buffer. A bare LoadLibrary harness ran both over 784,000
//       tie-heavy cases and compared the PERMUTATION, not the sortedness:
//       0 differences, with a stable-sort negative control caught in 7,571 of
//       7,800 cases. The tie rule the comment feared is one instruction:
//       `CMOVG`, not `CMOVGE`, so among equal keys the EARLIEST position wins.
//       The order is DESCENDING.
//   FUN_18007eefc / FUN_18007eec0 (_stricmp)           0x18007eefc
//       ***PORTED 2026-09-08 by Wave 9 lane COLL***
//       (src/engine/crt/msvc_stricmp.cpp). The warning below is confirmed and
//       QUANTIFIED: a signed-byte lowering comparison disagrees in SIGN with
//       this one in 169,849 of 400,000 randomised high-byte pairs, so a shared
//       "TreeStrCmp" really would be wrong for one of the two trees.
//       The CRT's own copy. 0x18007eec0 is `__ascii_stricmp`: it lowers only
//       'A'-'Z' and compares the bytes UNSIGNED (`MOVZX`). Worth writing down
//       because it is the MIRROR IMAGE of the trap configuration.cpp records:
//       that file's comparator must use SIGNED chars, this one must not.
//       A single shared "TreeStrCmp" serving both would be wrong for one of
//       them on any byte >= 0x80 — and a package path can contain one.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 5. THE ORACLE: THERE IS NONE, AND HERE IS WHY, RATHER THAN A WEAK ONE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// LoadPackages cannot be replayed and cannot be shadowed on a scratch object:
//
//   * It is NOT a pure read. It heap-allocates one 0xF0-byte PackageFile per
//     package, opens each .pkg on disk (172 MB of them on this install), grows
//     an array, builds a tree of one node per FILE INSIDE every package, and
//     frees a temporary array. Running it twice mounts every package twice.
//   * A scratch-`FileSystem` stand-in — the trick that made lane FS's
//     SetupDirectories replayable — does not work either. SetupDirectories
//     reads two bytes and writes three Strings; LoadPackages' output IS the
//     process's file-system state, and the objects it builds are handed to a
//     singleton the rest of the engine reads.
//   * The the diff oracle below is therefore a SHADOW, not a comparison, and it
//     is labelled as one. It prints the four counts the body produced. It can
//     catch "the port ran and did nothing"; it CANNOT catch "the port ran and
//     built the wrong tree", and quoting it as a verification would be the
//     thing this project has been burned by repeatedly
//     (reference_probe_needs_an_effectiveness_control.md).
//
// The three small rows in this file DO have real oracles — they are pure, they
// take a hidden return slot, and replaying them onto a second scratch Filename
// costs nothing. Those replays snapshot their inputs before the call, per
// reference_oracle_must_snapshot_aliased_inputs.md.
//
// And the honest bottom line, stated once: **nothing in this file has been
// executed.** No build of the game, no run, no log. §8 is a prediction, not a
// report.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 6. LANE FS's `ExistsInPackfile` HOLDBACK, RE-DERIVED FROM SCRATCH
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Lane FS declined `?ExistsInPackfile@FileSystem@IO@@QEBA_N…` (0x1800ab180,
// ord 2322) because inside SetupDirectories the packfile gate is 0, so the arm
// is dead. **That reasoning is correct and it is now spent.** Re-derived here
// without inheriting any of it:
//
//   1. `?Exists@FileSystem@IO@@QEBA_N…` is ALREADY PORTED
//      (src/engine/io/filesystem.cpp:151) and its first arm is
//      `if (fs->existsInPackfileGate != 0 && ExistsInPackfile(fs, path))`.
//   2. That call goes through RT_EXPORT_ONCE — the port-aware door — and
//      `?ExistsInPackfile@FileSystem@IO@@QEBA_NAEBVFilename@System@@@Z` has NO
//      RegisterRuntimeExport and NO RegisterRuntimeAddr anywhere in the tree
//      (checked by grep over runtime/, standalone/, engine/, code/, src/render/dx11/).
//   3. FileSystem::Startup sets the gate to 1, and it does so BEFORE calling
//      LoadPackages — i.e. before this file even runs.
//
// So from the instant `FileSystem::Startup` executes, EVERY `Exists()` call in
// the process evaluates `ExistsInPackfile` first, and at cutover that is a call
// through a null pointer. The same paragraph applies verbatim to
// `?PlatformExists@FileSystem@IO@@AEBA_N…` (0x1800adc70), the other arm, also
// unported, also reached through a live door.
//
// **This is a live cutover hole that no instrument in this project reports**,
// for exactly the reason lane FS §4.1 gave about WideString: an RT_EXPORT_ONCE
// to an unported symbol is indistinguishable from one to a ported symbol until
// it runs. It is not in THIS row's call chain, so this lane does not port it —
// but it is upstream of everything, and the integrator should treat it as
// higher priority than the row I was given.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 7. ONE MINT ROW IS NEEDED, AND HOW ITS SIZE WAS ESTABLISHED
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The mint is the integrator's file and is not touched here. The row:
//
//     ??_7PackageFile@IO@@6B@   DLL 0x180155700   9 slots
//
// Size established by READING THE BYTES at 0x180155700, not by trusting the
// mangled name — the name says nothing about length, and this wave has already
// paid once for a `PAD` suffix that put an 8 KB buffer in an 8-byte slot. Nine
// consecutive qwords there are code addresses inside .text (0x1800259d0,
// 0x180025150, 0x180025130, 0x1800b6080, 0x1800b6090, 0x1800b60a0, 0x1800252d0,
// 0x180025300, 0x1800252f0); the TENTH qword is 0x0000000000000000 and the
// bytes immediately following it are the ASCII "%08lX%04hX%04hX…" format
// string, i.e. the next object in .rdata. So the table is nine slots and the
// terminator is observed, not assumed.
//
// `??_7Base@Object@@6B@` (0x180154788) and `??_7External@Object@@6B@`
// (0x1801547a0) — the other two vtables that constructor writes — are ALREADY
// in rt_data_mint_tables.inc (lines 1212 and 1229). Only PackageFile's is
// missing, which is why ??0PackageFile is declined in §4 rather than ported:
// porting it today would write a garbage vtable pointer into every package.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 8. PREDICTION FOR ATTEMPT 12, AND WHAT WOULD FALSIFY IT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The next fault is `[RtUnresolved] ?FindFiles@FileSystem@IO@@QEBAX…`
// (0x1800ad7a0, ord 2350), EXEC of 0, symbolising inside
// **RtIo_FileSystem_LoadPackages** — a function that does not exist in the
// binary today — and **THE STACK FRAME MOVES DOWN ONE LEVEL**: #1
// RtIo_FileSystem_LoadPackages, #2 RtIo_FileSystem_Startup, #3
// RtEngine_Engine_Startup. This deliberately differs from lane FS's attempt-10
// prediction, which said the frame would NOT move; the frame moves here
// because LoadPackages now HAS a frame, where before it was the callee that
// never existed.
//
// FALSIFIERS, in the order they are worth reading:
//
//  * A fault naming `?ClosePackages@` means the gate byte at +0x18 was ZERO
//    and §3 is wrong — no, worse: it means the gate was zero and yet
//    ClosePackages was reached, which is impossible, so it would instead mean
//    the ClosePackages REGISTRATION did not take. Check the
//    `[RtPort] IO: N exports registered` count moved by 4.
//  * A fault naming `?GetPackDirectory@` means the early `if (gate == 0)`
//    return fired and then… it cannot: GetPackDirectory is past the gate. It
//    would mean lane FS's `packDirectory` field at +0x10 is not where they
//    said, and the copy ctor faulted on a bad `this`.
//  * **NO fault at all, and the boot proceeding past FileSystem::Startup,
//    falsifies this hardest.** That would mean `FindFiles` is somehow already
//    satisfied — which the source checker says it is not — or that the gate is
//    zero and the whole body was skipped. The tell between those two is
//    trivial: with the gate zero, `[the diff oracle] IO::FileSystem::LoadPackages` shows
//    `calls=1` with the shadow ABSENT, because the early return is before the
//    shadow. `calls=1` plus a shadow printing `pkgs=0` would mean the body ran
//    and mounted nothing, which is a different and much more interesting bug.
//  * A fault naming `??0PackageFile@` or `?ReadPackfile@` instead of
//    `?FindFiles@` would mean FindFiles IS satisfied from somewhere this lane
//    did not find — and would be good news, since it moves the wall two calls
//    further in one step.
//
// And the honest caveat on all four: **no run has happened.** This is derived
// from the disassembly and from the registration list, not observed.

// deliberately NOT the full 16-byte ArrayHdr. FindFiles receives `&tmp` and
// owns the growth.
// FindFiles' out-parameter is `RtIO::FilenameArray` (src/engine/io/FileSystem.h).

// ClosePackages passes `IO::FileSystem::_singleton` (ord 4811, retail
// 0x1801fc6a8), not its own `this`, to CloseFile — retail loads
// `MOV RCX,qword ptr [0x1801fc6a8]` at 0x1800abaef even though `this` is in
// RDI and is almost certainly the same object. Reproduced literally.

// ---- the array-growth idiom, inlined TWICE by retail ----------------------
//
// This is Collection::Array<PackageFile*>::SetSize(n+1) with the element
// written in, and MSVC emitted it in full at 0x1800ab5bb and again at
// 0x1800ab75d — the two copies are instruction-for-instruction identical apart
// from register allocation. One C++ function serves both, exactly as
// src/engine/collection/array.cpp does for its eleven identical destructors.
//
// Four things a "cleanup" would quietly break, so none of them is cleaned up:
//
//  * `if (newCount != oldCount)` guards the whole thing. newCount is
//    oldCount+1, so it is always true. Retail tests it anyway; so do we.
//  * The growth factor is `newCount * 3`, and ONLY when this is the very first
//    element past capacity (`newCount == oldCount+1`) AND the array was not
//    empty (`oldCount != 0`). A first-ever append therefore allocates capacity
//    1, not 3 — `LEA EAX,[R13+0x1] ; CMP R14D,EAX ; JNZ ; TEST R13D,R13D ; JZ`
//    at 0x1800ab5de.
//  * The copy loop starts at `oldCount` when the block did NOT move
//    (`CMOVZ EAX,R13D` on `CMP R15,[RSI+0x20]`) and at 0 when it did. It is one
//    loop doing both the memcpy and the append.
//  * `if (dst)` inside the copy loop is retail's and is kept: it can only fire
//    when the base is null, which is the out-of-memory path.
//
// The allocation goes through RtMemAlloc, which is
// `?MemAlloc@MemoryAllocator@System@@SAPEAX_KH@Z` (0x1800c7a50) — verified by
// disassembly to be exactly the lock / Allocate(_singleton,size,align) /
// unlock sequence retail inlines here, same slots (0x18014b390 / 0x18014b388),
// same allocator singleton (0x1801fc718), same align 8. Likewise RtMemFree is
// 0x1800c7ad0 and carries retail's `if (p)` inside itself, which is why the
// callers below hand it a possibly-null pointer exactly as retail does.

// This is lane FS §2's control-flow-reach pruning applied again. The FIRST call

// FileSystem: packfileCount is 0, so the loop body never runs; packfiles is
// null, so the free is a no-op; packfileIndexRoot is null, so the tree teardown
// is skipped. Three unported callees — CloseFile, the recursive node free at
// 0x180008340, and PackageFile's deleting destructor through vtable slot 0 —
// are therefore NOT REACHED, and this row closes without them.
//
// **THAT IS TRUE OF THE FIRST CALL ONLY, AND IT IS NOT A GENERAL LICENCE.**
// The mods menu remounts packages (see project_mods_menu_closed.md), which
// calls this again with a POPULATED array and a POPULATED tree — and then all

// dies with a name instead of silently leaking every package. Do not read the
// paragraph above as "these callees are dead"; read it as "these callees are
// dead on iteration 12's boot".
//
// UPDATE 2026-09-08 (Wave 9 lane COLL): two of those three callees — the
// recursive node free at 0x180008340 and, via LoadPackages, the BST insert —
// are now PORTED, so the mods-remount path no longer dies with a name; it
// runs. CloseFile and the deleting destructor are unchanged.
//
// ORACLE: none, and it is not close. It frees everything it touches; running it
