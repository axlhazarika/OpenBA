// src/render/vulkan/present.h -- the pre-rotated present pass (NOT RETAIL)
// ============================================================================
// docs/vulkan/PLAN.md §3.5 / §4.5. A surface whose currentTransform is not IDENTITY (an Android
// phone held in landscape: its panel's natural orientation is portrait, so the transform is
// ROTATE_90 or ROTATE_270) is presented WITHOUT the compositor's rotation pass when the swap
// chain is made with preTransform = currentTransform and its images in the panel's own
// orientation; the content must then be drawn rotated. Creating it with IDENTITY instead works,
// but every present answers VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR (Android 10+), which the frame loop answers with a
// rebuild, every frame.
//
// The engine keeps rendering one landscape frame of the back buffer's size. When the swap chain
// is pre-rotated, that frame is the backend's own image (SourceImage / SourceView: the frame's
// "main colour" for draw.cpp, its Resolve and read-back source), and the frame's end draws it,
// rotated, into the acquired swap-chain image (Record): one fullscreen triangle sampling it at
// the inverse of the transform. The shaders are OpenBA's own (present/present.vert, .frag, compiled
// to present/present_spirv.h by tools/vulkan/gen_present_spirv.sh). On an IDENTITY surface (every
// desktop) nothing here is made and the frame renders straight into the swap-chain image as before.
