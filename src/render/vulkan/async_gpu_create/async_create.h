// src/render/vulkan/async_gpu_create/async_create.h -- ext.async_gpu_create, the Vulkan side
// (docs/extensions/handins/ASYNCGPUCREATE.md, issue #13)
// ============================================================================
// NOT RETAIL (P4). The Vulkan twin of src/render/dx11/async_gpu_create/async_create.h. Retail creates
// every resource synchronously in its Serialize, on the loader thread. With the row on, the loader
// bracket (DeviceData::Slot4(true) ... Slot4(false), on the loader thread) DEFERS that thread's
// data-seeded static creates to worker threads:
//   - everything engine-visible is decided on the loader exactly as the synchronous path decides it (the
//     owner's size / dynamic, the image's shape and samplers, ext.texture_quality's drop);
//   - a job owns a copy of its seed bytes and runs the synchronous path's create (seeded_create.h: the
//     compress_ao conversion and the share_gpu_data create-or-share run on the worker too), then its
//     publish step writes the companion's fields, before the object counts as done;
//   - Await(obj) before every use of a companion's GPU object (bind, lock, set data, update, read, a
//     save, a re-create, the destructor) waits for that object's own job;
//   - Slot4(false) waits for every job of the load (End), so a finished load has created everything it
//     would have created synchronously. DeviceData::Shutdown drains first.
// Vulkan object creation is free-threaded and the backend's allocator and upload batch take their own
// locks (resources.h), so every device has the worker path (no DriverConcurrentCreates question).
// Off (the row, any thread outside the bracket): the synchronous path, plus one relaxed load per use.
