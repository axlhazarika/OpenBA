// (docs/extensions/handins/ASYNCGPUCREATE.md, issue #13)
// ============================================================================
// NOT RETAIL. Retail's VideoDX11 creates every resource synchronously in its Serialize, on the
// loader thread (buffers.cpp GpuBuffer_Serialize -> Create, imagebufferdata.cpp Create). A MegaMod
// boot makes ~160k immutable vertex / index buffers and ~18k textures that way: a third of the
// loader's time is the driver's CreateBuffer / CreateTexture2D (handins/ASYNCGPUCREATE.md §1).
//
// With the row on, the loader bracket (Engine::Loader::Run's DeviceData::Slot4(true) ... Slot4(false),
// on the loader thread) DEFERS the data-seeded immutable creates of that thread to worker threads:
//   - the descriptors are built on the loader exactly as the synchronous path builds them, and every
//     engine-visible field (the owner's size / dynamic, the image registry, the nulled views) is
//     written there too, in the same order;
//   - a job owns its initial data (the buffer's scratch block, a copy of the texture's level bytes)
//     and the device it was enqueued against (AddRef'd), and writes the D3D11 handles into the same
//     companion fields the synchronous call writes, with the same values on success and on failure;
//   - Await(obj) before every use of a companion's handles (bind, map, update, read, re-create,
//     destroy) waits for that object's own job, so nothing ever sees a half-made resource;
//   - Slot4(false) waits for every job of the load (End), so a finished load has created everything
//     it would have created synchronously. Shutdown and the device-lost path drain first.
// Off (the row, a driver without concurrent creates, any thread outside the bracket): retail's path,
// unchanged, plus one relaxed atomic load per use (Await's fast path).
